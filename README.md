# dotfiles-and-scripts
Dotfiles and scripts providing cumbersome configure details for Emacs, Zsh, etc. 

## Installation
1. It won't overwrite existing files, so move those out of the way first.
2. Clone this thing wherever you like (I use ~/.dotfiles).
```
   git clone  https://github.com/han1475/dotfiles-and-scripts.git
```
3. install GNU stow, and run the install.sh script. That'll set up a bunch of symlinks in your home directory (e.g., ~/.bashrc â†’ ~/.dotfiles/bash/.bashrc).

## Tips
This isn't really intended for anyone's use but my own, and it's catered to my way of doing things (duh), so, you know, be prepared for that.

Enjoy! =)
