# dotfiles-and-scripts
Dotfiles and scripts providing cumbersome configure details for Arch Linux, Emacs etc. 

## Installation
### Arch Linux
To Be Continued.
### others
Clone this thing wherever you like (I use ~/.dotfiles), install GNU stow, and run the install.sh script. That'll set up a bunch of symlinks in your home directory (e.g., ~/.bashrc â†’ ~/.dotfiles/bash/.bashrc).

It won't overwrite existing files, so move those out of the way first.

This isn't really intended for anyone's use but my own, and it's catered to my way of doing things (duh), so, you know, be prepared for that.

Enjoy! =)
